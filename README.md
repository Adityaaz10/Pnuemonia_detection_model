# Pnuemonia_detection_model
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for pneumonia detection in medical images using ResNet18 and PyTorch. The notebook automates the extraction, preprocessing, and transformation of chest X-ray data, trains a transfer-learning CNN for binary pneumonia diagnosis, and validates model accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. The workflow includes robust image augmentation, model fine-tuning, and interpretable results through GradCAM-based visualization. It also features a Gradio-based web app for interactive demo and prediction on new images
